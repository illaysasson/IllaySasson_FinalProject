    <h1>Happiness & The Internet</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        The internet has been around for a while, and although it was always considered a good thing, there's a good possibility that it's not.
        While it does give us endless possibilities for things like news and entertainment, it also damages communication in real life and opens a door
        to things like bullying and cybercrimes. So - is the internet really the best thing that happened to humanity or does it lead to unhappiness?

        <h2>Dangers of the Internet</h2>
        <p>
            The internet can be dangerous. Some people see it as a way to bully, con or abuse others. Cybercrime is also a common feature of the internet.
            While the internet may seem innocent on the outside, there are places like the darknet - websites that are unsupervised and unmonitored.
            Sites like these are always a recipe for disaster. Internet safety is one of the most important things to keep in mind while browsing the internet,
            which is why the subject is being taught around the world all the time.

        <h2>My Resources</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, the 3 main technological tools I used are Python, Pandas and Flask. All of these are tools recommended to us by our Data Science teachers,
            because they are being used all around the world in the current industry. In our class we were encouraged to learn these tools by ourselves,
            so websites like Stack Overflow and W3Schools were a huge help. For my datasets, I mainly used kaggle to help locate interesting datasets, among other websites.
